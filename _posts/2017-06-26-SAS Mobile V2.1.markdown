This application is divided into four modules, such as Initial page, Meals ,News, and Bus.
In the news section allows the student to view all the news related to the IPVC allowing also to view the complete news. In the menus section you can view all meals including the new Vegetarian and Diet, Grill and Hint, you can also select allergies so that you can view all meals that contain allergens. One of the important news in the menus section is the reservation of packs, all students who have packs can already book meals, so you do not need to send an email as they used to.
